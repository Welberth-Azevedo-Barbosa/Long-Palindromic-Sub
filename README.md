# Long-Palindromic-Sub
Solution for "Leetcode 5. Longest Palindromic Substring"

# Description

This is a Python algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

The algorithm implements a centered expansion approach to find the longest palindromic substring. It starts with substrings of size 1 (each individual character) and expands from the center to check if the substring is a palindrome. It keeps track of the longest palindromic substring found so far and updates it as necessary during iteration.
